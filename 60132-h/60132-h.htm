<h3 id="c2">PURPOSE</h3>
<p>Visitors to Yellowstone have for many years found the larger
mammals of the region of unusual interest. The demand for
some printed information in general terms and at a reasonable
cost have prompted the preparation of this handbook.</p>
<p>The aim of this publication is to provide those interested with
a few facts about the more commonly seen mammals of Yellowstone.
People want to be better informed on the variety of animals
found here; this handbook should be helpful. It is hoped
that the statements concerning locations where certain species
are most apt to be seen will assist many people to enjoy the
pleasures of watching these animals and observing their interesting
behavior. The illustrations and descriptions of the various
species are intended to aid in the identification of animals
seen for those not familiar with wildlife. If the book fulfills
these needs it will have served its purpose.</p>
<h3 id="c3">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>
<p>The assistance of Dr. C. Max Bauer, Chief, Geology Branch
(retired), National Park Service and of Chief Park Naturalist
David de L. Condon in making criticisms and suggestions on the
material presented here is acknowledged. The cooperation of
the Yellowstone Library and Museum Association in publishing
the book is appreciated and I wish to thank Yellowstone National
Park for the use of copies of original paintings by E. J. Sawyer
for some of the illustrations. I also wish to acknowledge the aid
rendered by all others who participated in the editing and completion
of the manuscript for publication.</p>
<h3 id="c4">NOTES</h3>
<p>The scientific names used were taken from A FIELD GUIDE
TO THE MAMMALS by Burt and Grossenheider, and where subspecific
names are used, they were checked in the Journal of
Mammalogy for current usage. The authorities for each name
are omitted here as not having any particular interest to the
non-professional. Those study specimens available in the
Yellowstone Museums were used as reference material. The
title &ldquo;Wild Animals of Yellowstone National Park&rdquo; is used, even
though this book treats only the mammals and omits dealing
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
with other animal life forms. The average person thinks of
mammals as the animals and usually thinks of other life forms
by more specific names.</p>

<h3 class="center" id="c5">EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE</h3>
<p>This second edition of WILD ANIMALS OF YELLOWSTONE
NATIONAL PARK has been revised by the Naturalist Staff at
Yellowstone. The revisions consist mainly of a revision to the
scientific names of the animals to bring them into conformance

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872
by an act passed by the Congress of the United States of America.
It is a mountainous area mostly in the northwestern corner
of Wyoming, with small sections extending into Montana and
Idaho. The area set aside as a National Park is 3,471.51 square
miles. It provides within its boundaries environmental conditions
which make it possible for many of the mammals representative
of the Rocky Mountains to carry out their complete
life cycle without fear of persecution by man.</p>
<p>The men that first conceived the idea of preserving the
Yellowstone area as a great National Park were primarily concerned
with the preservation of the natural wonders such as the
geysers and hot spring phenomena, the canyon and waterfalls,
and the lakes. In those days little thought was given to the need
for preserving our wild animals. However, it soon became apparent
that the wild animals, once thought to be unlimited in
numbers, would have to have protection if they were going to be
preserved for future generations. Yellowstone soon became
known nearly as much for its wildlife as for its natural wonders.</p>
<p>The wild animals of Yellowstone National Park are widely
distributed over the park area, some of them being restricted
to limited areas due to the difference in elevation and the availability
of the certain types of habitat which they require, while
others range over a wider part of the park, especially during
certain seasons of the year.</p>
<p>The higher mountain meadows are ideal summer ranges for
the larger mammals. These animals would normally work down
into the lower country outside of Yellowstone to the north for
the winter. Since that area is now mostly under fence they have
been forced to do the best they can up in the winter snows of the
lower sections of the park. Bears and several of the smaller
animals go into hibernation as soon as or even before the first
snow squalls of winter appear so the long winter in the high
country holds no terrors for them.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the National Park Service to present these
animals to the visiting public in as near their natural environment
as possible, each species being left to carry on its normal
existence unassisted wherever possible. Unfortunately the lack
of sufficient winter range within the park for unlimited numbers
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
of animals has made it necessary that the numbers of bison, elk
and antelope be controlled and management practices be put into
effect in order to hold the number down to the carrying capacity
of the range. So far these three species of animals have presented
the only problem as far as overpopulation is concerned.</p>
<p>Predatory animals, especially the coyote, wolf and mountain
lion were at one time controlled by hunting. The present policy
is to let the predators carry on their own normal life as it is
believed to be best for them and all other animals concerned
and only in unusual circumstances will any control measures be
carried out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">ANIMALS</span></h2>
<h3 class="center" id="c9">PRONGHORN
<br />Antilocapra americana</h3>
<p>The Pronghorn or American Antelope was almost as well
known as the buffalo to the early settlers of the West. In fact it
has been estimated, by some, to have been present in nearly as
large numbers as the buffalo but never to have concentrated in
such large herds.</p>
<p>It once ranged the territory from eastern Kansas, western
Iowa and Minnesota westward to the valleys of California and
northern Mexico northward to southern Saskatchewan and Alberta.
It is a typical animal of the plains and open rolling country&mdash;few
animals are more fleet or wary than the pronghorn. Unfortunately
their curiosity in regard to any object that they do not recognize
or understand helped make them a fairly easy mark for the
hunters. Many are the tales of the pronghorns being coaxed into
gun range by their curiosity in a handkerchief or strip of bright
cloth waving in the breeze.</p>
<p>The pronghorn is the only antelope in the world with branched
or pronged horns and has the unique characteristic among all
hollow-horned ruminants of shedding the outer covering of the
horns annually. In the Yellowstone area this horny sheath sheds
from the permanent bony core usually during November or December.
The core is covered with a blackish skin, at first, then
finally by the horny material that forms gradually downward
from the tip.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of these animals is a conspicuous
rump patch composed of white hairs, longer than any found elsewhere
on the body. Through development of certain muscles it
is possible for the animal to erect these white hairs until they
stand out stiffly forming a dazzling white rosette. This is done
in times of excitement and is usually considered a danger signal.</p>
<p>The tiny antelope kids are born in late May or June, usually
twins but sometimes one or three. During the first several
days after birth they remain carefully hidden in the grass but
soon gain their strength and are able to keep up with their mother.
It is interesting to note that antelope does occasionally seem
to act as baby tenders for other does. Observers have reported
upon a number of occasions seeing from four to six or seven
kids following one doe without any other doe being visible in the
immediate vicinity; or sometimes two does may be together with
eight or ten young. The same practice has been observed with
the bighorns.</p>

<p class="pcap">Pronghorn</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Enemies are principally coyotes, bobcats, and eagles in the
case of the young.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A little smaller than the average deer,
with simple horns slightly curved and with one lateral prong.
Horns present in both sexes though smaller or sometimes lacking
in the female. Color reddish-brown or tan with darker brown
to blackish mane, white rump and whitish or creamy underparts.
Males about 54 inches in length, height at shoulder 34 to 36 inches
and weight 100 to 125 pounds. Females smaller.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;buck; female&mdash;doe; young&mdash;kids.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Near Gardiner, between Gardiner and Mammoth,
Swan Lake Flats, Mammoth to Tower Fall, along Yellowstone
River below the Canyon and in the Lamar River valley and Slough
Creek area. The park antelope population fluctuates over the
years from a minimum of about 200 animals to a maximum of 800.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c10">BISON (BUFFALO)
<br />Bison bison</h3>
<p>The Yellowstone Park Bison or Buffalo is one of the remnant
groups of the former millions that once roamed over the country
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Gradually pushed backward or killed by the advancing line of
the settlements they were finally confined to the plains areas
west of the Mississippi, where, in the period shortly before and
after the Civil War, great numbers were slaughtered yearly until
the seemingly countless herds were thoughtlessly reduced to a
straggling few. In fact, they were almost exterminated before a
relatively small group of persons became conscious of the condition
and through continued efforts were able to bring about the
preservation of a few small herds, herds that through careful
protection and management have now increased to possibly
25,000 head, mainly in Canada. With the exception of the beaver,
the bison played a more important role in the life of the Indian
and the settler than any other animal in the country.</p>
<p>The bison, while doing well under management practices, has
fortunately resisted domestication. They are of very uncertain
disposition and it is dangerous to approach them closely on foot.</p>
<p>Protected by a coat of thick hair, quite shaggy on the foreparts,
the bison is able to withstand the severest weather of winter.
He doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind as long as it is possible to paw
or root down through the snow to reach the grass beneath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>

<p class="pcap">Bison</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The single bison calf is usually born between April and June,
and at first is red brown in color, short necked but without the
noticeable hump of its mother. They are hardy and playful and
soon able to follow the herd. Mother very carefully watches her
calf and protects it at all times.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A large, ox-like animal with large head
and short curved horns, a high hump at the shoulder and very
heavy forequarters. Dark brown in color, hair very shaggy on
the foreparts. Bulls total length about 11 feet, height at shoulder
70 inches and weight 1800 pounds or more. Cows about 7 feet
in length, 60 inches height and 800 to 1200 pounds in weight.
Both sexes have horns but those of the cows are smaller.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;bull; female&mdash;cow; young&mdash;calf.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: East of Tower Junction along the Lamar River
and northward. A herd on Pelican Creek, one ranging in Hayden
Valley, and another in the Lower Geyser Basin. During the summer
months small numbers may occasionally be seen along the
Gibbon River, Madison River, in the Lower Geyser Basin, in
Hayden Valley and along the east shore of the lake between Fishing
Bridge and Lake Butte. The larger herds go into the higher
country during the summer and are seldom seen.</p>
<p>An attempt is made through management operations to maintain
a park population of from 1000 to 1200 of these animals.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c11">WAPITI (ELK)
<br />Cervus canadensis</h3>
<p>The American Elk or Wapiti is, with the exception of the
moose, the largest member of the deer family in North America.
Once widely distributed over much of North America it has now
been eliminated from most of its former range until now the
Yellowstone region has the largest number of wapiti to be found
in the world. There are smaller numbers in scattered places in
the Rocky Mountains from northern New Mexico to Montana,
Idaho, Washington and Manitoba, with small introduced herds in
other places.</p>
<p>The elk is the most polygamous of the deer family. In the
fall each bull tries to collect the largest harem he can and many
spectacular fights result from the clash of rivals that may try
to rob each other of a part of the herd. It isn&rsquo;t long, however,
until the bulls forget their rivalry and, leaving the cows, they
get together by themselves until the next fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="454" />
<p class="pcap">Elk</p>
</div>
<p>In the past elk were in the habit of feeding up into the mountains
during the summer and migrating to lower country for the
winter. The westward-moving settlers gradually took over the
winter range for agriculture and forced the elk to remain in the
mountains throughout the year. Winter hardships have been
severe and many of them have died of starvation. This lack of
winter range has always been a serious problem in caring for
both the northern and southern Yellowstone herds. They depend
more upon grass as food than the other members of the deer
family.</p>
<p>The cow elk has one, rarely two young at a time, which are
born in May and June. At first they are weak and so are kept
hidden for several days until able to keep up with their mother.
The young are spotted for the first few months, but lose their
markings by late summer.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A very large deer with a shaggy mane and
short tail. The males with widely branching antlers which are
shed annually; females do not have antlers. In color the sexes
are slightly different. The males have head and neck a dark
chestnut brown, sides and back a yellowish to brownish gray.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Females less strongly marked but both with a large straw-colored
rump patch. Males much larger than females. Total length.
Males 115 inches, height at shoulder 60 inches, weight 700 to
1000 pounds. Females 88 inches in length, 56 inches in height,
and 500 to 600 pounds in weight.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;bull; female&mdash;cow; young&mdash;calf.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: The elk migrate to the higher meadows during
the summer but some are usually to be seen in the meadows
along the Madison River, the small meadows between Mammoth
and Old Faithful, between Norris and Canyon, and from the Lake
to the East Entrance. The over all summer park population
usually equals or exceeds 15,000 animals.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c12">MOOSE
<br />Alces americana shirasi</h3>
<p>The Moose is the largest of our North American deer. The
Shiras Moose which is found in Yellowstone and surrounding
areas is slightly smaller than the typical American moose, which
is found in the northern states east of the Rockies and north to
the Arctic. In Europe the moose found there is commonly called
elk. This has of course resulted in some confusion between it
and our animal known as the elk.</p>
<p>The large, ungainly and grotesque appearing moose is very
unlike the graceful deer. The ugly face with its long nose, high
and heavy shoulders and much smaller hindquarters, and the
long legs all tend to make its appearance seem a caricature.
But in spite of his size, appearance, and his mighty spread of
antlers, the bull moose can, if he chooses, drift through the
woodland as quiet as a mouse; then again he may give the sound
effect of a herd of elephants on a stampede.</p>
<p>Marshy meadows and the margins of lakes or streams are
the favorite summer haunts of the moose. His usual summer
diet consists of the various aquatic plants and his long legs are
of great assistance in wading for the plants as well as helping
him get through the deep snows of winter. The moose is better
fitted to withstand the rigors of winter than the deer and elk and
is accustomed to remaining in higher country during the winter.
During such times his food is made up of the foliage, twigs and
bark of trees and shrubs. Moose are powerful swimmers and
dive for aquatic plants if the water is too deep for wading.</p>
<p>The moose calf is born late in May or June, usually one the
first year and frequently twins thereafter, but rarely triplets.
They remain with their mother during the first year. She is
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
very protective and does not hesitate to attack any animal or
human that she thinks may harm the calves. In fact, any moose
has a very uncertain temper and it is not wise to approach one
too closely.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="420" />
<p class="pcap">Moose</p>
</div>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A large, dark-colored animal with heavy
humped shoulders, a large head with broad, pendulous muzzle,
large ears; throat with a hanging growth of skin and hair called
the &ldquo;bell.&rdquo; Males with broad, heavy, palmate antlers which are
shed annually; average spread 52 to 58 inches; females do not
have antlers. Total length of animal about 9 feet, height at
shoulder 66 to 78 inches and weight 900 to 1400 pounds. Females
about three quarters the size of males. Color blackish-brown
with pale brown along the back and pale ears; legs washed with
tawny gray.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;bull; female&mdash;cow; young&mdash;calf.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Most likely to be seen in Swan Lake Flat and
Willow Park between Mammoth and Norris; in the Dunraven
Pass area; along Lewis River above Lewis Canyon and between
Fishing Bridge and the East Entrance. Active all day but they
are best seen early in the morning or in late afternoon and evening.
Moose are also numerous in the Falls River Basin, Pelican
Creek, Slough Creek areas and along the Yellowstone River
above the Lake. These animals are thought to number between
500 and 700 for the entire park area and seem to maintain a
rather constant level.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 class="center" id="c13">MULE DEER
<br />Odocoileus hemionus</h3>
<p>The Rocky Mountain Mule Deer, or Blacktail Deer, is a popular
animal in the park. The Whitetail deer also was sometimes
found in the lower elevations in earlier times but has not
been seen in the park for some years. The mule deer gets its
name from the family characteristic of the very large mule-like
ears.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="602" />
<p class="pcap">Rocky Mountain Mule Deer</p>
</div>
<p>Mule deer are generally distributed over most of the park
during the summer but do not tend to go above timberline as
much as do the elk. In the winter they drift down to the lower,
more protected ranges, but, not in migratory herds as the elk do.</p>
<p>Their food consists of grass, twigs, foliage of trees and
shrubs, plants and fruits. They especially like leaves and buds
and sometimes prove destructive to the shrubbery about the developed
areas where the landscaping must be protected.</p>
<p>The fawns, one, frequently two and occasionally three in
number, are born in late May to July. They are beautiful little
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
spotted creatures that are kept hidden for a time until able to
follow their mother. Quite frequently people, upon finding a
fawn hidden in the bushes, take it away thinking that something
has happened to its mother. This should not be done for it almost
invariably does much more harm than good. Once in a
while something does happen to the mother but in most cases
she is not far away and will return to the fawn when the proper
time comes.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A rather large deer with large ears; antler
tines pronged; tip of tail black. Female without antlers.
Males shed their antlers sometime between December and April
annually. Summer color tawny to yellowish brown with large
patch of white on rump, throat white. In the winter they are dark
gray instead of brownish. Males, total length 68 inches, height
at shoulder 42 inches and weight 150 to 200 pounds for the average
buck. Females smaller.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;buck; female&mdash;doe; young&mdash;fawn.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: In the summertime they are well scattered over
the park and may possibly be seen along the trails at the edges
of open meadows along the roadside, or near developed areas,
day or night. The population varies from year to year and of
recent years from a maximum of 1200 to a minimum of about
600.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c14">BIGHORN
<br />Ovis canadensis</h3>
<p>An interesting inhabitant of the roughest, rockiest mountain
country as well as the high arctic alpine meadows is the Bighorn
or Rocky Mountain Sheep. The sure-footedness with which they
will dash, in full flight, up or down seemingly impossible slopes
is truly amazing. Negotiating with ease places that the most
skillful mountaineer, with all his climbing equipment, can scale
only by slow and laborious means. Even the picturesque ram
with his great recurved horns can leap from point to point with
grace and agility.</p>
<p>It might well be mentioned here that the fable of the ram
habitually jumping and landing on his horns is not true. They
are used, however, as fighting equipment and the shock they can
withstand is terrific as the rams square off about thirty yards
apart, then dash at each other until they collide head-on with all
the speed and power they can muster. This continues until one
or the other finally retires groggily from the scene. The ewe
also has horns but they are short and only slightly curved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="375" />
<p class="pcap">Bighorn</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Bighorns eat practically any of the plant life that grows within
their domain, which is preferably near and above timber line
in the summertime. There they remain during the summer. In
the winter they select either open, windswept slopes that will be
kept free from snow or else drift down to the lower, more protected
places in the valleys.</p>
<p>The bighorn ewe has one or two lambs which are born in the
spring. Their lambs soon learn to play like our domestic sheep,
and before they are very old are given their mountain-climbing
lessons by watchful mothers. When still quite small they can
follow the band with almost as much skill as the older ones.</p>
<p>Their ancient enemies are the wolves, coyotes, mountain lions,
bobcats and, in the case of the young, the eagles. In Yellowstone,
wolves, lions and bobcats are now rare in occurrence. These
create a hazardous life for the mountain sheep. Then with the
addition of man and his impact upon them they have had trouble
even holding their own and in recent years are threatening to
become another of our vanishing species, especially because of
the keen competition with elk for forage.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A large, blocky wild sheep, covered with
a thick coat of hair, not wool, brownish to grayish brown in color
with a creamy-white rump. Males with massive horns which curl
back, out, downward then forward and up. Females with more
slender, short and slightly curved horns. Total length five to
six feet, 38 to 42 inches in height at shoulder and 200 to 300
pounds in weight. Females smaller.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;ram; female&mdash;ewe; young&mdash;lamb.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Summer in higher mountain ridges especially
around Mt. Washburn, Quadrant Mountain and on Sepulchre Mountain.
In winter they usually migrate down lower especially to
the Mt. Everts section between Mammoth and Gardiner. They
are often seen in the vicinity of the junction of the Lamar and
Yellowstone Rivers and occasionally near Oxbow Creek. Of recent
years the Yellowstone population seems to be declining.
The population has changed from an estimated maximum of about
400 to an estimated minimum of 170.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c15">BLACK BEAR
<br />Ursus americanus</h3>
<p>The question most frequently asked by the park visitor is,
&ldquo;Where can I see a bear?&rdquo; For this natural born clown of the
woods is probably our best known park animal. The black bear
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
is smart and quickly adapts himself to a life of comparative ease.
Why rustle for a living when a few antics and a little begging
about the camps or along the roadside will produce a nice array
of scraps or sweets, thinks he.</p>
<p>That is when the trouble starts for both bear and visitor.
For Mr. Bear, regardless of how friendly he may seem, is a
dangerous, wild animal, capable of inflicting severe injury by
one blow of his powerful paw or a bite from his well-armed jaws.
A visitor who feeds or even approaches a bear too closely not
only is risking injury to himself but is contributing to a condition
that may cause the injury of an innocent visitor in the future.
He also is violating regulations which have been established in
an attempt to provide protection for the visitor and the animals.</p>
<p>Once fed, the bear continues to expect food. He prowls around
the camps and a smell of food is an invitation to break into cabin,
tent or car, which he can and does do with comparative ease.
The offenses he commits pile up&mdash;injuries to persons, damage
to property&mdash;until the offender must be either taken for a long
ride or shot. One less bear for a visitor to see, yet the visitor
has done much to cause this by his failure to observe the rules
against feeding these animals. Every year a long list of personal
injuries, varying from slight to serious occur. Property damage
incidents accumulate in ever-increasing numbers. For your
safety, for the safety of other visitors and the sake of the bear
do not feed, molest, tease or treat him as a pet. Help to keep
them as a natural part of our wildlife.</p>
<p>The cinnamon and brown bears of this country are simply
color phases of the black bear, the blonds and brunettes of the
family. The various graduations of color are frequently intermixed
in the same family; hence it is a common occurrence to
see a black bear female with brown cubs, a brown and a black
cub, or even all three colors.</p>
<p>The bears hibernate during the winter months, usually from
late October or November to March or April depending upon the
weather conditions. In the fall they put on a thick layer of fat
which furnishes the needed nourishment during the winter. During
this hibernation they are not in a deep sleep as has sometimes
been thought; they remain conscious and although sleepy
are frequently restless and move around occasionally. Hibernation
dens are usually in caves, or under windfalls, buildings or
other protected places.</p>

<p class="pcap">American Black Bear</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>It is during hibernation that the young are born, usually in
January. At first the cubs are very small, only about eight inches
long, weighing from eight to twelve ounces and are naked, blind
and helpless. The black bear usually has two cubs though occasionally
one, three or four. The cubs grow rapidly and are
able to follow their mother around when she comes out of hibernation.
If mother is a highway or camp beggar the cubs soon
learn it too and then the trouble starts. The female bear is a
good mother and it is extremely dangerous to come between her
and the cubs. She makes the cubs mind, spanking them vigorously
if they fail to do so. The cubs hibernate with their mother
their first winter and are then usually weaned by the next summer.
The female black bear has a new litter of cubs only every
two or three years.</p>
<p>These animals are omnivorous, eating anything that comes
their way, grass, fruit, berries, roots, mammals, birds, carrion,
grubs and ants, fish, frogs etc.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A medium-sized bear, with considerable
variation in color, from glossy black to cinnamon brown or yellowish,
often with a brown muzzle. Claws of forefeet curved
and slightly longer than those of hind feet. Its generally smaller
size, straight facial profile and lack of shoulder hump distinguishes
the black from the grizzly bear. Adult blacks can climb
trees readily. Sexes are alike in appearance, with total length
of about 60 inches, tail 5 inches, height at shoulder from 25 to
35 or more inches and weight from 200 to 400 pounds, occasionally
over.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;boar; female&mdash;sow; young&mdash;cubs.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Throughout the park, though most frequently seen
in the vicinity of camps and cabin areas. It is possible to see
them any time night or day but it is dangerous to approach them
too closely at any time; a mother with cubs is doubly dangerous.
Extreme care should be used in parking to watch bears so that
you do not create a highway traffic hazard which endangers the
lives of others. Do not permit the bear to approach closely.
Never place yourself or others in a position of danger with respect
to these animals.</p>

<h3 class="center" id="c16">GRIZZLY BEAR
<br />Ursus horribilis ssp.</h3>
<p>There are probably more Grizzlies in Yellowstone Park now
than in any other area of the United States. Elsewhere they have
been reduced by extensive hunting. Members of this genus are
the largest and most formidable of the carnivorous animals of
North America. The variety found in the park is probably surpassed
in size only by the Giant Brown Bear of Alaska and the
White Bear of the Arctic seas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>

<p class="pcap">Grizzly Bear</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Fortunately the Yellowstone grizzly is inclined to mind his
own business and is not addicted to the panhandling or clowning
traits of the black bear. He does sometimes come into the camps
and cabin areas in search of food but generally is seen only rarely
by visitors. In the woods, if given a reasonable chance, he
will move away from your vicinity. However, a grizzly surprised
at close range will frequently charge the person, surprising him.
In this event a tree is the safest place to attain as the adult
grizzly is unable to climb trees.</p>
<p>The grizzly is a large animal but in spite of this is able to
travel with tremendous speed and can outrun a horse for a short
distance. He is powerful enough to kill elk and other large animals
and he does doubtless occasionally attack large mammals
if the opportunity seems favorable. He often takes sick or feeble
animals or young ones. However, the grizzly is usually content
to make a diet of grass, roots, berries, fruits, mushrooms,
ants, mice, rats, gophers and other small animals and any carrion
he happens to find. In areas outside of the park occasional
individuals have been known to kill cattle, sheep and hogs.</p>
<p>The grizzly hibernates like the black bear, although frequently
at higher elevations, where the period is longer due to weather
conditions.</p>
<p>Grizzly cubs are born in January and are blind, naked and
helpless, and weigh possibly as much as a pound at birth. One
or two, and occasionally three or four, are born in each litter.
Litters usually occur every second or third year. A grizzly
cub can climb trees readily until he is about a year old, after
that his claws become too long and blunt and he loses his inclination
for climbing.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A large heavily built bear with a dished
face that gives a concave profile, a broad head and a hump at
the shoulders. Tail short, claws long and slightly curved with
whitish or yellowish streaks. Color subject to seasonal and individual
variation, yellowish brown to blackish with a sprinkling
of whitish or silvery-tipped hairs. In winter the coat appears
grayer with the silver hairs more pronounced, hence the name
Silvertip. Underparts are colored the same except for lacking
the grizzling. Sexes colored alike but the females are somewhat
smaller in size than males. Males are six to eight feet in length,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
tail two inches, with height at shoulder from three to nearly four
feet. The weight varies from 350 to 900 pounds with some individuals
running to nearly 1200 pounds.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;boar; female&mdash;sow; young&mdash;cubs.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Throughout the park but most common near the
Canyon, Fishing Bridge and Old Faithful. Usually stirring around
most frequently in the evening or during the night.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c17">COUGAR
<br />Felis concolor</h3>
<p>Mountain Lion, Panther, Puma or Painter are other names
applied to this, the largest of our North American unspotted
cats.</p>
<p>In spite of blood-tingling tales to the contrary, under normal
conditions the cougar is a harmless animal as far as man is
concerned. For unless wounded or cornered it is extremely
shy and is one of the most difficult of wild animals to see under
normal circumstances. Physically it is quite capable of killing
an unarmed person but generally its inclinations are to very
carefully avoid humans instead. However, if wounded, in defending
its young, or treed in the chase this cat should be respected.</p>
<p>The cougar is frequently a wide-ranging hunter and its hunting
territory may be the area in a radius of thirty to fifty miles
from the home den. For that reason it is widely distributed and
does not become very numerous in any comparatively small
area.</p>
<p>The range of the cougar is comparable with that of the various
species of deer since they and the other larger mammals of that
type are the cougars&rsquo; preferred food. They have been found to
be quite destructive to domestic stock also and have been extensively
hunted for that reason. Normally the cougar does not
kill more than it needs at a time and is known to cache the uneaten
portion of a carcass for future use. However, occasional
animals have acquired reputations as killers.</p>
<p>A cougar&rsquo;s den is usually in a cave but may be in the shelter
of windfalls if a suitable cave is lacking. Here the young, from
one to three or four in number, averaging two, are born. They
are generally born in late winter or early spring, but may be
born in any month of the year. Like our domestic cat, the cougar
is a playful animal; adults as well as young have been found to
be rather easily tamed. The young are spotted for approximately
six months after birth.</p>

<p class="pcap">Cougar</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A very large cat with a proportionally
small head and a long cylindrical tail. Body long, lithe and powerful.
Fur soft and rather short, of a tawny or dull yellowish-brown
color. The males are somewhat larger than females.
Length 7 or 8 feet and weight about 150 pounds.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;tom or lion; female&mdash;lioness; young&mdash;cubs or
kittens.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Rare in the park and has seldom been seen. Ranges
the timbered mountain areas and may be about during the daytime
but most usually in the evening or night. Its scream is
supposed to be blood-curdling but that of the bobcat has probably
been mistaken for the cougar on frequent occasions. Cougars
have been reported so rarely and their sign seen so little that
they are considered one of the rarest of animals in the park.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c18">COYOTE
<br />Canis latrans</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;little wolf&rdquo; was a common sight on the western prairies
in earlier times, his nightly serenade ringing out from the summits
of the buttes through which the lonely trails wound. In
spite of the persecution by man the coyote is just as common,
even now, in many parts of his range, and even in the more settled
farming areas his intelligence and wily ways have enabled
him to continue a precarious existence.</p>
<p>Coyotes are not only accused of making serious depredations
on game animals but on domestic animals as well. It is true
that they have caused damage in stock-growing areas among
sheep, poultry and young animals, for in such areas other food
is scarce. The coyotes of Yellowstone were originally blamed
for serious wildlife losses until the results of careful research
proved differently. This research has shown us that the chief
food of the coyote consists of marmots, picket-pins, mice, rabbits
and other small animals as well as carrion. Seldom are
larger wild animals killed other than the young, the old, sick or
crippled that are comparatively easy prey. It was customarily
assumed that when coyotes were seen on a carcass that they
were the cause of the death, when actually many of the animals
died from other causes before the coyotes found them.</p>
<p>In fact, the elimination of the coyotes, it is thought by some,
would mean the increase of rodents to such an extent that we
would be faced with a serious problem of over-population of
them, as well as a probable increase in disease among the larger
animals. The deer, elk and others of the larger animals, in
good physical condition, are capable of killing the coyote and it
is a frequent sight to see several of them chasing a coyote instead
of being chased. An over-population of coyotes can become
a menace to any animal, large or small, and in some instances
control of coyote numbers has been found necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>

<p class="pcap">Coyote</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The coyote home is in some little cave or cavity among rocks
or a burrow in the ground. The five to seven young are born in
April and are well cared for by both parents. By August they
are nearly full grown and are hunting in family groups. Come
winter the young disperse to new range areas and have been
known to travel many miles from their place of birth.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A rather small, slender animal resembling
a shepherd dog in general appearance, with a fairly long and
heavy coat, coarsely grizzled buffy, grayish and black, almost
yellowish in some subspecies; underparts lighter. Tail large
and bushy. Males larger than females. Total length 3&frac12; to
4&frac12; feet; height at shoulder 16 to 18 inches and weight 35 to 45
pounds.</p>
<p>Here in Yellowstone large coyotes are frequently mistaken
for the gray wolf which is very rare. However, the wolf is a
much larger, heavier and more powerful animal, weighing from
80 to 100 or more pounds and is 5&frac12; or more feet in length.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Male&mdash;dog; female&mdash;bitch; young&mdash;pups.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Throughout the park at practically all elevations.
Most frequently seen in the open meadows in daytime or evening.
Howls most often during the night. Often seen in the winter on
the lower range lands, especially around or near the carcasses
of animals which have died and become carrion.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c19">GRAY WOLF
<br />Canis lupus</h3>
<p>To many weary emigrants crouched beside their campfires
along the rutted wagon trails which lead onward into the west
and to many lonely homesteaders sitting in their cabins on a
wintry night the eerie sound of the long deep howl of the Gray
Wolf, drifting along on the night wind, gave a feeling of foreboding
and a threat of the sinister. Actually the wolf&rsquo;s howl is very
much like that of a large dog and the wild setting is required to
give the feeling that it imparts to the listeners.</p>
<p>This animal has been known under the various names of Gray
Wolf; Timber Wolf; Lobo; Loafer and Buffalo Wolf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="497" />
<p class="pcap">Gray Wolf</p>
</div>
<p>Once widely distributed over most of the United States the
several species of wolves have been exterminated over most of
their range and are now restricted to a few of the more remote
areas. The wolf is almost entirely carnivorous in food habits
with a preference for the larger wild animals and domestic stock
when available and so has been persistently hunted by man. Due
to their larger size, appetites and different characteristics from
those of the coyote the wolves were not able to adapt themselves
to the inroads of civilization and so have been pushed continually
farther back into the unsettled areas and may soon vanish entirely
from the scene.</p>
<p>Wolves became rather numerous at different times in the
earlier days of this park&rsquo;s history. They were persistently
hunted during the period of the Army administration and for a
time after the National Park Service took over the administration,
until the time that the policy of letting the predators carry
on their own natural existence unmolested was established. During
this first period the numbers of the wolves were so depleted
that today they are very rare in the park area.</p>
<p>Park visitors frequently mistake one of the larger coyotes for
a wolf and report it as such. But to a person familiar with both
animals there is a decided difference. The average wolf is nearly
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
twice as heavy as a coyote, larger and more powerful, with larger
legs and feet and a broader head and muzzle. They are seldom
seen from the highways except possibly in the winter and there
have been no more than one or two authentic sight records of the
animals or their tracks reported annually in recent years.</p>
<p>Wolves ordinarily utilize either a natural cave, a hollow log,
a hole dug in the ground by themselves or one dug by other animals,
for a nursery den. According to several authorities, the
nest for the young is not lined with any material. The young,
numbering from 3 to 13 but usually 6 to 8, are born in March or
April. They are blind and nearly naked. Most evidence found in
available literature indicates that the adults pair permanently
and the male assists in securing food for the family.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: Much like a large dog, larger, heavier and
more powerful than the coyote. There is no color difference between
males and females and the individual varies little if any
in color during the different seasons of the year. However, there
is a great color variation between different individuals, the color
ranging from gray, either light or dark, sprinkled with black or
darkish on upper parts and yellowish white underparts to dark
and almost black individuals. Males are largest, averaging from
75 to 100 pounds or more in weight and over five feet in length.
Females from 60 to 80 pounds and slightly under five feet.</p>
<p><span class="u">Term</span>: Male&mdash;dog; female&mdash;bitch; young&mdash;pups.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Might be encountered in various sections of the
park but most recent records are from the northeast part from
Canyon north and east to Lamar River and Slough Creek drainages.
Probably follow the elk herds in the winter.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c20">GOLDEN-MANTLED MARMOT
<br />Marmota flaviventris nosophora</h3>
<p>The Golden-mantled Marmot is one of the familiar animals
of Yellowstone. Known to many people as a woodchuck or groundhog, the
Yellowstone representatives never worry about whether
they will see their shadow on the proverbial groundhog day.
They remain snug in their beds for they know that they don&rsquo;t
want to come out for another six weeks or more anyhow.</p>
<p>In fact, they spend over half of their life sleeping, for they
hibernate from about the first of September until early April.
The summer months are then spent in accumulating a layer of
fat to carry them through the next long sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Marmot</p>
</div>
<p>Marmots are found throughout the park at all altitudes wherever
suitable rocky slopes can be found. They are commonly seen
from the highway on rock piles or near culverts. Such areas
provide the most suitable protection since they are slow and fat
and easily caught if found too far away from a safe retreat.
Easily tamed, they soon adjust themselves to the presence of
numerous visitors and even congregate in the vicinity of lodges
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
and cabin areas where shelter under buildings is handy and
scraps of food are plentiful.</p>
<p>The marmot well deserves its early name of &ldquo;Whistler&rdquo; for
his piercing warning whistle is commonly heard whenever anything
startles him. And immediately upon hearing it every other
marmot in the vicinity pops his head up for a quick look, then
starts for home. Their favorite retreat is on a rock or knoll or
log, near the home entrance, where a good view of the surrounding
area can be had. Bears, badgers, coyotes, lynxes and some
of the larger hawks are their principal enemies.</p>
<p>Their food consists of vegetation of various kinds, clover,
grass, seeds, and foliage of native plants as well as cultivated
crops when such are within their feeding range. In some instances
marmots have proved quite destructive to gardens and
other crops.</p>
<p>The marmot&rsquo;s home is either in a burrow dug in open ground
or under boulders or in cavities under rockslides. In this den,
the young, numbering from four to six, are born in May. The
adults usually hibernate earlier in the season than the young as
it takes the latter a little longer to get the necessary accumulation
of fat to sustain them over the winter.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A large rodent with a heavy-set body and
short tail. Head broad and short, ears low and rounded, fur long
and coarse. The color is ochraceous above and reddish below
with golden-buff mantle on the anterior back. The males are
about 24 inches in length, maximum weight about 10 pounds.
Females a little smaller.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Throughout the park at all elevations except in
heavy-timbered areas. They are out at any time during daylight
hours.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c21">MONTANA MANTLED GROUND SQUIRREL
<br />Citellus lateralis cinerascens</h3>
<p>This Ground Squirrel is frequently mistaken for a chipmunk
although quite a bit larger in size. This mistaken identity is
chiefly due to the stripes on the side of the back. It must be
remembered, however, that the real chipmunk has stripes on
the face also which this ground squirrel does not have. They do
look and behave much like big chipmunks, especially resembling
the chipmunk of the eastern states.</p>
<p>The Mantled Ground Squirrel seldom climbs much above the
ground and lives in burrows or crevices in the rocks or under
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
logs. They prefer grassy, open, forested areas rather than
open meadows.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="480" />
<p class="pcap">Mantled Ground Squirrel</p>
</div>
<p>These little animals are quite easily tamed and soon learn to
hang around camps and parking areas where they wait to be fed.
They are equipped with cheek pouches which they fill until they
appear to have an extra bad case of the mumps.</p>
<p>They hibernate in the late summer or early autumn and emerge
again the following April. A supply of food is stored during the
summer season; however, the heavy layer of fat acquired is the
nourishment for the winter sleep.</p>
<p>Only one litter of from four to seven young is born each season,
usually during May.</p>
<p>Their food consists of seeds, grain, buds, green vegetation,
insects and their larvae, and occasionally young birds, eggs and
mice. Chief enemies are hawks and the various small carnivores.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A small to medium sized ground-dwelling
squirrel, larger and more robust than chipmunks but not as
heavily built as the Uinta Ground Squirrel. Tail about half as
long as the head and body, flat and bushy. Color of upper parts
dark chestnut red mantle bordering which are light-gray stripes
with black on either side of the light stripe; under parts yellow
to yellowish-white. Upper parts grayer in winter. No stripes
on side of head. Length about 11 inches. Sexes alike.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Generally distributed over the park and is best
seen around camps and woodland margins. Active in daytime only.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 class="center" id="c22">UINTA GROUND SQUIRREL
<br />Citellus armatus</h3>
<p>This Ground Squirrel, commonly called Picket-pin, is abundant
throughout most of the open, grassy valleys of the park. It
comes into lawns and frequently lives under nearby buildings.</p>
<p>The picket-pin is extremely curious and the sight of any
strange object or movement immediately has him standing rigidly
on tip-toe to examine whatever attracted his attention. This
position he assumes does so resemble the appearance of a pin
to which some horse was previously tethered that the reason for
the origin of his name can readily be seen.</p>
<p>These little animals spend over half of their lives sleeping
in their snug underground nests. They spend the summer accumulating
a heavy layer of fat and then go into hibernation late
in August to emerge the following April.</p>
<p>The young, from five to fourteen in number, are born in May
or June. Only one litter a year is born; however, this species
is so numerous and prolific that its many enemies can hardly
keep it in check.</p>
<p>Most common enemies are badgers, coyotes, bears, foxes,
weasels, hawks and most small carnivores. These all depend
upon the picket-pin for at least part if not considerable of their
diet during the summer and they frequently are dug out after
they are in hibernation. This control is beneficial since the
picket-pin is a host to the wood tick carrying spotted fever.</p>
<p>The food of the ground squirrel is chiefly seeds, nuts, grain,
green vegetation, roots, insects and larvae with occasionally
young birds, mammals and eggs. It stores grain and seeds in
underground storerooms for emergency use the following spring
as it does not eat during the winter hibernation.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A terrestrial, burrowing squirrel with
short tail and small ears, body robust with short limbs. Tail
about one-quarter the total length, flat and moderately bushy.
Color mixed gray and black with a wash of dark brown on the
back; underparts gray washed buffy. Sexes alike. Total length
about 11 inches.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Open, grassy areas throughout the valleys of the
park. Active in daytime only.</p>

<h3 class="center" id="c23">CHIPMUNK
<br />Eutamias sp.</h3>
<p>One of the most active and interesting of the smaller animals
of the park. This genus is represented in the park by three
species.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="565" />
<p class="pcap">Chipmunk</p>
</div>
<p>Chipmunks are chiefly terrestrial in habit although they can
and do frequently climb into low trees and bushes. The different
species of Western Chipmunks vary greatly in their preferred
habitat from sagebrush flats to heavily wooded areas. Each type
of environment has its distinct type of chipmunk.</p>
<p>The color patterns of the chipmunks vary, each type having
its own distinctive pattern; however, the group as a whole is distinguished
from other squirrels by the stripes on both body and
face. The smaller ground squirrels may have some stripes on
the body but do not have striped faces.</p>
<p>Chipmunks are universal favorites with visitors. Lively, interesting,
and full of curiosity, they are quite easily tamed and
soon learn to frequent the picnic areas and campgrounds. Here
they take their toll of food bits from each group of people, either
eating it on the spot or carrying it away to store for future use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Their food consists mainly of seeds, berries, nuts, buds,
some insects and any food scraps they may chance to find around
camps. Their winter stores are located close to their nest, in
underground cavities.</p>
<p>The chipmunks are not active outside during the stormy periods
of winter but since they do not become fat in the fall and use
some of their food stores during the winter it is not thought that
they go into a complete period of hibernation like some of the
other animals. Exactly what they do and how they live in Yellowstone
during the winter, however, remains yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Their nest is made underground as they burrow into the earth
at the foot of a stump, log or rock. In this nest the litter of four
to six young are born in the spring. It is not likely that they
have more than one litter a year here in the north.</p>
<p>The following forms of Chipmunks are found in Yellowstone
Park:</p>
<h4><span class="u">Buff-bellied Chipmunk</span>&mdash;Eutamias amoenus luteiventris</h4>
<p>This is the abundant little striped chipmunk seen throughout
most of the park along the roads and trails and around camp
sites. Upper parts with five dark and four light longitudinal
stripes from shoulder to base of tail. Median stripe from crown
to root of tail. Whitish stripes bordered by dark, above and below
eye. Underparts buffy; color rich; 8&frac12; inches over-all
length.</p>
<h4><span class="u">Uinta Chipmunk</span>&mdash;Eutamias umbrinus</h4>
<p>Generally scattered over the park but not as common as the
above. Larger in size, 10 inches over-all length; under parts
whitish and stripes not as conspicuous as in the Buff-bellied.</p>
<h4><span class="u">Wasatch Chipmunk</span>&mdash;Eutamias minimus consobrinus</h4>
<p>These little chipmunks were reported by Bailey to be found
near Yellowstone Lake and near the eastern and southern boundaries
of the park in high, open valleys. They are hard to distinguish
from the buff-bellied chipmunk, as their white belly
is somewhat concealed. They are slightly smaller in size. A
gray form of this species has been reported from Swan Lake
Flat but it is probably rare.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c24">PINE SQUIRREL
<br />Wind River Mountains Red Squirrel, or Chickaree
<br />Tamiasciurus hudsonicus ventorum</h3>
<p>These little animals are abundant throughout the forested
sections of the park. Lively and noisy, they immediately give
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
voice to a tirade of scolding and chattering at the approach of
an outsider to their domain.</p>

<p class="pcap">Pine Squirrel</p>
</div>
<p>Friendly by nature they become quite tame wherever the
park visitors are found, especially such areas as provide an
opportunity to pick up chance bits of food. Alert and inquisitive
they pry into anything that attracts their attention.</p>
<p>This squirrel has been frequently accused of destroying the
nests of its bird neighbors and eating the eggs and young. This
is true to some extent, especially among certain individuals.
However, some of this damage is compensated by their unintentional
benefit in assisting in reforestation. Cones and seeds
that are buried for winter use are frequently overlooked and
some of these later germinate and grow.</p>
<p>Pine squirrels do not hibernate during the winter and are active
at all times except during periods of storms. They build
warm nests either in hollow trees, woodpecker holes, or balls
of leaves and fibers firmly anchored among the branches of a
tree. They industriously collect large stores of cones for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
winter food supply. These are either stored in hollows or more
often buried in storage pits in the ground. After the ground is
covered with its winter blanket of snow the squirrels make numerous
tunnels under the snow which gives them access to the
storage places and act as a protected place where they can
scamper about.</p>
<p>The young are usually born in May or June, and number four
or five to the litter with seldom more than one litter a year.
Young squirrels are blind, naked and helpless for several weeks
after birth.</p>
<p>A pine squirrel&rsquo;s diet consists of nuts, seeds, berries, inner
aspen bark, mushrooms, and some animal food such as birds&rsquo;
eggs and fledglings.</p>
<p>Its enemies are hawks, owls, pine martens and weasels, and
occasionally the larger carnivores.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A small arboreal squirrel with flat, bushy
tail; fairly long ears and fairly long pelage. Dark olivaceous
with white underparts in summer, while in winter it is rusty-red
above, sides olive-gray and underparts gray. Sexes alike. Total
length about 13&frac12; inches, tail over &#8531; of the length.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Abundant in all forested areas. Active during the
daytime only.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c25">Beaver
<br />Castor canadensis missouriensis</h3>
<p>The quest for the fur of this little wilderness engineer did
more to bring about the exploration of the west than any other
one factor. The first daring explorers were continually pushing
ever forward into the unknown regions searching for the wealth
of furs and establishing the fur trade with the Indians. Thus,
the first white man known to have entered the region later known
as Yellowstone Park was John Colter, the representative of a
fur trader.</p>
<p>These activities greatly depleted the beaver populations but
under protection in recent years they have staged a satisfactory
recovery in many parts of their former range.</p>
<p>The dams constructed by this animal are well known. Made
of sticks, logs and mud, they are a remarkable accomplishment.
The dam is for the purpose of impounding a pond of water in
which to construct the beaver lodge or house. This also is made
of sticks and mud with a room in the middle, above water level,
reached by several underwater passages. The pond must be of
sufficient depth to provide plenty of water below the level of the
winter ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Beaver</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Sometimes when suitable ponds or still water are available
the beaver digs a sloping tunnel into the bank of a stream, with
a room at the end and above the high water level.</p>
<p>The beaver is a gnawing animal equipped with strong, sharp,
chisel-like teeth which it uses to cut down and trim the trees
for construction material for the house and dam as well as for
food. Expert at cutting down the trees but not as expert, as
stories say, in dropping the tree in a desired spot. This is not
premeditated. The tree falls where it may and has been known
to fall on the little sawyer when he failed to move away fast
enough. The tree, after being cut, is trimmed into suitable sections
and skidded to the pond and floated to the desired location.
The trees and shrubs preferred and mainly cut are willow and
aspen.</p>
<p>The beaver&rsquo;s winter diet consists of bark from the tree
branches that it stores up by sticking them into the mud at the
bottom of the pond. In the summer the bark diet is supplemented
by the addition of roots and green vegetation.</p>
<p>The four to six young are born in the house or the bank den
in May or June where they remain until able to make the underwater
swim to the outside where they soon assist their parents
in the work of the colony.</p>
<p>The beaver is equipped with a large flat paddle-like tail.
However, contrary to stories, he does not use it as a trowel or
as a means of transporting mud. It is an excellent rudder and
also a prop or brace for the owner while he stands up to cut
down a tree. The resounding slap of the tail upon the surface of
the pond is an excellent warning signal that immediately puts
the colony on guard.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: Largest of the North American rodents,
stocky, with webbed hind feet and broad, flat, scaly tail, ears
short, fur thick, rich dark brown. Total length 43 inches; weight
from 30 pounds to a maximum of 68 pounds. Tail 4 or 5 inches
wide and 12 to 16 inches long.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Along almost every stream in Yellowstone. They
might be seen in the beaver ponds in Willow Park, or along
Pelican Creek; or at the beaver ponds and Floating Island Lake
between Mammoth and Tower Fall. Longest dam in the park
approximately 1000 feet in length is at Beaver Lake opposite
Obsidian Cliff. The best time to see beaver is in the evening.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Beaver change their locations frequently and it is difficult to
predict, from season to season, where they can best be seen.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c26">OTTER
<br />Lutra canadensis</h3>
<p>This large member of the weasel family can outswim some
fish. His lithe shape and short powerful legs with broad webbed
feet make him an expert and his graceful maneuvers in the water
are very interesting to see.</p>
<p>The principal item of the Otter&rsquo;s diet is fish which are supplemented
by frogs or crayfish and such young ducks, muskrats
or other small mammals or birds as they may have occasion to
catch. Their habitat is therefore near suitable streams, lakes
or ponds. They have been known, on some occasions, however,
to undertake fairly long overland journeys between streams.</p>
<p>The otter is a rather friendly fellow, fairly easily tamed and
observed. They usually travel in pairs or family groups. Otters
are playful and are in the habit of making slides down steep clay-banks
or snowdrifts where they seem to have great sport coasting
down on the chest and belly, ending up in the water with a
loud splash. This they do over and over like a group of small
children.</p>
<p>The den is located near the water, either as a burrow in a
bank or under protecting tree roots or rocks. Here the one to
three or four young are born in late April, there being only one
family a year.</p>
<p>Otters are strong and capable fighters, a match for a dog on
land and more than a match for one in the water. They have no
particular enemies except man. The rich brown fur has brought
a high price on the fur market and trapping operations have resulted
in the animal becoming rare outside of such protected
areas as Yellowstone. The rather short dense pelt is considered
to be one of the most durable of furs and it, together with the
layer of fat underlying the skin, make the otter impervious to
the icy water in which he spends much of his time.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A long, lithe-bodied animal with webbed
feet and a long, tapering, muscular tail. Size large, head broad
and flat, legs short. Color of upperparts a uniform, dark, rich,
glossy-brown; underparts lighter with a grayish tinge. Total
length 40-45 inches, tail 12&frac12; to 15 inches; and weight 18 to 25
pounds.</p>
<p><span class="u">Terms</span>: Sexes&mdash;Male and Female; young&mdash;pups or kittens.</p>

<p class="pcap">Otter</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: They are active all of the year and are found on
many streams and lakes throughout the park. Best seen near
the outlet of Lewis Lake and near the boat docks at Lake and
West Thumb. Active at all hours.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c27">WESTERN MINK
<br />Mustela vison energumenos</h3>
<p>The mink is a large weasel of slightly heavier build and semi-aquatic
in habit. Found widely distributed in forests or on plains
but always along watercourses where it establishes its den.
This may be a burrow in the bank, under logs or rocks and similar
places.</p>
<p>They are strong and graceful swimmers and are fully capable
of catching trout and other fish which form a part of their diet,
as well as frogs and crayfish. They also hunt on shore for muskrats,
mice, rabbits, snakes, birds and similar forms of small
animal life. The mink is sometimes of bloodthirsty temperament,
killing for the pleasure, but is not ordinarily considered
quite as much inclined this way as the smaller weasels.</p>
<p>The odor of the musk carried by the mink as well as the other
weasels is strong and very offensive. This is released in moments
of excitement.</p>
<p>The mink has but one litter of young a year, numbering five
or six in the average litter, which are born in April or May.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A slender weasel-like animal nearly as
large as a house cat. Ears small, neck long, tail moderately
bushy. The fur is soft and dense, protected by long guard hairs,
rich, glossy dark sooty brown in color with a white area under
the chin. Total length 24 inches, tail 8 inches; weight up to 2
pounds, the females somewhat smaller.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Along some of the streams and ponds of the park
but not very common and seldom seen.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c28">ROCKY MOUNTAIN PINE MARTEN
<br />Martes caurina origenes</h3>
<p>This little animal is close kin to the famous Russian Sable
and has a valuable pelt or rich, dense fur. Expert climbers,
they hunt through the woods and capture a good portion of their
menu from the tree tops. Largely carnivorous the marten lives
on small mammals and birds. Its main foods in Yellowstone
are squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rabbits, grouse, and also some
nuts, berries, fruits, insects or honey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img" id="fig20">

<p class="pcap">Mink</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Fearless and pugnacious they frequently quarrel among themselves
and do not hesitate to snarl or spit at man. One time a
ranger was standing in front of a patrol cabin when a marten
came bounding toward him spitting and snarling at every jump.
To see what he would do the ranger made for the cabin door and
the marten came right after him even to the cabin door. It was
decided that they would be pretty tough to live with if they suddenly
became as big as bears with an increase in disposition
accordingly. A marten family quarrel sounds like a good cross
section of an alley-cat serenade. Being extremely active they
are able to elude most would-be enemies except possibly the
Great Horned Owl.</p>
<p>The marten nest is usually in a hollow tree or rarely in a
burrow, where the young, averaging 3 or 4 to a litter, are born
late in April. It is said that the young are blind for about the
four weeks after birth.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A small animal, of weasel-like form, a
little smaller and more slender than a house cat; head rather
small with ears broad and rounded, tail bushy and cylindrical,
about half as long as the head and body. Fur soft, rich yellowish
brown; legs, feet and tail dark brown; buffy patches on throat
and chest. Total length 25 to 28 inches, weight 1&frac12; to 4 pounds.
Males largest.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Fairly common throughout wooded sections of the
park but are shy and seldom seen, especially near habitations
except isolated cabins where they sometimes become rather
tame.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c29">PORCUPINE
<br />Erethizon epixanthum</h3>
<p>The Yellow-haired Porcupine of Yellowstone occurs all over
the park. Being an unsociable sort of fellow he is usually found
alone, except during the mating season or when the young are
yet with their mother. He is a common animal but seldom seen.</p>
<p>He is a heavy set, slow, clumsy animal with short legs and a
waddling walk. Very stupid and short-sighted with a habit of
complaining audibly to himself as he goes along. Since the porcupine
is well protected by a back full of loosely fastened quills,
he is very unpopular with the other animals, especially those
that might have an idea of making a meal of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="793" />
<p class="pcap">Pine Marten</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The quills are his only battle equipment but are sufficient
protection against most animals. Each individual quill is equipped
with sharp barbs at the tip which easily penetrate flesh, gradually
working their way deeper and are very hard to extract.
Porky, however, does not have the power to throw his quills, in
spite of stories to the contrary. When attacked he bristles up
and looks like an animated pincushion and a slap from his quill-loaded
tail is sufficient to fill the face and mouth of his would
be attacker with a painful collection of quills which he will long
remember.</p>
<p>The porcupine&rsquo;s nose is very sensitive, a good blow on it
being sufficient to kill him, so he has learned to tuck it down
between his feet for protection, and to turn so that his back and
tail are presented to the enemy. There are no quills on his underside
and an occasional enemy has learned to reach under
with a paw and quickly flip him over on his back in order to expose
the unprotected portion for final attack.</p>
<p>The principal food of the porcupine, in winter, is the bark
and small twigs of various trees. In the summer, the bark, buds
and foliage of many trees, shrubs and plants are used. Porky
is very fond of salt and will gnaw on anything that contains it;
shovel or other tool handles with deposits of perspiration on
them, or antlers after being shed, are a delicacy. Occasionally
he kills a tree by removing too much bark but seldom does
enough damage to be of economic importance.</p>
<p>One litter with usually one, or rarely if ever two young, is
born each year in late April or May. A baby porcupine at birth
weighs about a pound and is as large or larger than a bear cub.
The den is located among rocks, in cavities under logs or fallen
tree tops. However, during most of the year, even in the winter,
the favorite place is well up in the tops of the trees.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A large, clumsy rodent with fairly soft
hair with which is mixed longer, coarser hair and many stiff,
sharp, barbed spines or quills over the upper parts and tail.
Tail short, thick and muscular. In color black with longer hairs
tipped with greenish-yellow. Total length 32 inches, weight 15
to a maximum of 35 to 40 pounds.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: In all timbered areas of the park and is sometimes
seen near the roadsides or trails either during the day or night.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c30">BADGER
<br />Taxidea taxus</h3>
<p>Many of the smaller animals, especially those of the rodent
group, are known for the dens and runways that they dig, some
of them becoming rather expert at this activity. Their burrowing
activities, however, are undertaken primarily as a means of
providing a suitable home for the animal. The Badger, however,
is equipped by nature as an excavating machine. He, too, makes
a burrow for use as a home but this is only a small part of his
digging activities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>

<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="256" />
<p class="pcap">Badger</p>
</div>
<p>Badgers are equipped with large strong claws, especially on
the forefeet, and backed by powerful muscles they can literally
dig themselves out of sight in a surprisingly short time, throwing
out a stream of dirt behind them like a mechanical elevator.
It is this ability that he depends upon as a means of securing
his food. Badgers are rather clumsy, heavy bodied and short
legged animals, lacking the speed and dexterity needed to capture
their prey in the open, but how they do like to dig for their food!
Living primarily on the smaller rodents, especially ground
squirrels, the badger snoops from burrow to burrow until his
nose tells him that the occupant is at home, then dirt starts to
fly. If the ground squirrel has provided his home with some
extra entrances and he is quick to use one of them he may escape,
otherwise the badger has secured a dinner.</p>
<p>Entirely beneficial from the standpoint of the kind of food he
eats, the badger&rsquo;s activities in obtaining it soon result in numerous
holes throughout the area where his foraging operations
are carried on. In areas where domestic stock are ranging
these excavations made by the badgers are hazards to the stock
and rancher alike, often resulting in a broken leg to the horse
that steps into a hole and sometimes serious injury to the rider
when he is thrown from the horse as it falls. In such areas this
animal is usually hunted or trapped by man. In Yellowstone he
is left to live an undisturbed life. The badger is a fearless and
vicious little fighter, which combined with his digging ability
makes him a match for anything but man and his gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Badgers inhabit the plains and prairies or open forests,
wherever their principal food items of ground squirrel, gopher
or prairie-dog can be obtained. They generally hibernate from
October to March, except in the southern portions of their range.
The young, probably averaging about three to a litter, are born
in May or early June.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A low, heavy bodied animal with short legs,
short bushy tail and long shaggy fur. Color a silvery gray grizzled
with black. Head rather small, broad and flat with black
and white striped markings. Total length 28 inches and weight
averaging about 14 pounds.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Northern part of the Park from Mammoth to
Tower Junction and the Lamar Valley, in open sections. Occasionally
seen in meadows of the interior parts of the park
where the picket-pins are to be found. Badgers are not numerous, but
could be called commonly seen residents, especially
of the northern side of the park.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c31">SAGEBRUSH WHITE-FOOTED MOUSE
<br />Peromyscus maniculatus artemisiae</h3>
<p>The White-footed Mouse, Deer Mouse, or Vesper Mouse is
an interesting little animal, a member of a very large and widely
distributed genus whose members are generally the most common
small animal of any given region. They are clean little
creatures with large bright eyes, large ears, and tails about as
long as their bodies, with gray or brown upperparts and white
feet and lower parts.</p>
<p>These mice are found throughout the forests, among rocks,
in meadows and open grassy places, living in burrows, among
rocks, or in hollow trees and logs and they frequently come into
camps and houses. They are expert climbers and will readily
take refuge in trees as well as into burrows if the occasion
warrants.</p>
<p>White-footed mice depend upon seeds and grains, small nuts
and dry vegetable matter for their food rather than green vegetation
like the meadow mice, and are rarely carnivorous.</p>
<p>They may have three or four litters of 3 to 7 young each year
and so are able to keep pace with the activities of their enemies
which include all of the smaller carnivorous animals and the
owls.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: Upper parts, pale cinnamon to brownish
fawn, more dusky along mid-back; underparts and feet white.
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Total length 6 to 7&frac12; inches with the tail being one-third to
one-half of the total length.</p>

<p class="pcap">White-footed Mouse</p>
</div>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: It is possible to find them almost anywhere in the
park but since they are nocturnal they are rarely seen in the
daytime.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c32">MEADOW MOUSE OR VOLE
<br />Microtus sp.</h3>
<p>The Meadow Mouse is one of the more common and widely
distributed of our small mammals. There are many species
and subspecies and some form is to be found practically anywhere
in North America.</p>
<p>These little mice prefer the open meadow country where
there is plenty of grass the entire year. They may be found in
the moist to semi-arid sections and anywhere from sea level to
above timberline elevations.</p>
<p>Their presence can be readily detected by the characteristic
runways through the grass. The mouse makes the runway both
by cutting some of the grass and pushing the balance to the side,
and the floor of the runway is kept free from all obstructions.
A colony of mice will have a regular labyrinth of these paths
with frequent openings into underground burrows and nests. The
young are usually born in the underground nests. However,
many of the species also build surface nests of thick balls of
grass which are used during the winter time. In these nests,
when snow blankets the landscape they are warm and secure,
and able to run about their passage-ways, beneath the snow in
their daily quest for food, for they do not hibernate.</p>

<p class="pcap">Meadow Mouse</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The food of the meadow mouse is chiefly vegetation: grass,
foliage, seeds, twigs, roots and bark and at times they may become
very destructive to field crops and orchards.</p>
<p>This little animal is very prolific and usually has several
litters each year, with each litter consisting of from four to eight
young. Were it not for their many enemies they would soon overrun
the grass lands and do untold damage. As it is, their enemies,
which are practically every predatory animal and bird,
can barely keep them in check. Meadow mice serve as a valuable
source of food for the smaller predatory animals such as
coyotes, foxes and for the various hawks and owls.</p>
<p>There are four species of these mice that have been found in
Yellowstone Park:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint"><span class="u">Sawatch Meadow Mouse</span>: Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus.
A medium-sized mouse with upperparts dull ochraceous,
sprinkled with black. Underparts soiled whitish to ashy
or cinnamon. In winter many black hairs along upperparts
and underparts with wash of creamy white. Total length
7 inches, tail 1.8 inches. Has been found at Mammoth Hot
Springs, Upper and Lower Geyser Basins and Shoshone
Lake.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="u">Dwarf Meadow Mouse</span>: Microtus montanus nanus. A small-sized,
rather short-tailed mouse with upperparts everywhere
mixed gray, sepia and blackish, feet grayish; tail
bicolor, dusky gray and whitish; underparts whitish. Total
length 6 inches; tail 1.6 inches. Found in the grass of
meadows and upland slopes over most of the park and
appear to be the most abundant and generally distributed
of the meadow mice in the park.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="u">Cantankerous Meadow Mouse</span>: Microtus longicaudus mordax.
Resembles Sawatch meadow mouse in size but the tail is
longer, ears larger, and color grayer. Upperparts grayish
bister; sides grayer, underparts whitish. Lighter
colored in the winter. Total length 7.4 inches; tail
2.8 inches. These mice have been found at Mammoth and
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Tower Fall and are probably common in most of the
meadows of the park, equally at home on dry ground or in
mountain streams.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="u">Big-footed Meadow Mouse</span>: Microtus richardsoni macropus.
Largest of the meadow mice. Total length 8.8 inches;
tail 2.8 inches. Upperparts dark sepia mixed with black,
sides paler, feet gray; tail bicolor sooty whitish; underparts
washed with silvery-white. In winter grayer above,
more white below. Usually found close to water where
they swim much in the manner of muskrats. This mouse
had been taken at Heart Lake and its runways seen in
marshy meadows of most of the western part of the park.</p>

<h3 class="center" id="c33">WOOD RAT
<br /><span class="u">Gray Bushytail Wood Rat</span>&mdash;Neotoma cinerea
<br /><span class="u">Colorado Bushytail Wood Rat</span>&mdash;Neotoma cinerea orolestes</h3>
<p>Pack Rat or Trade Rat is the name commonly applied to this
individual, represented in the park by both of the above forms.
Pest of the stations and patrol cabins because of his fondness of
getting into buildings and collecting items of every description,
especially those of shiny appearance. These are packed to his
nest, which is located either in rock piles, cliffs or whenever
possible in or around buildings. He cuts open food containers,
bedding and other contents and makes a general mess.</p>
<p>He frequently leaves some object in place of the stolen article,
hence the name trade rat. However, this trade is probably due
to his dropping something that he was already carrying, when
he spied the new object that was more attractive, rather than
any desire to make a fair trade. They gather anything that is of
a convenient size to carry.</p>
<p>The wood rat is a very clean animal, of no relation to the
common barn rat except in superficial resemblance. A vegetarian
in diet he lives on green vegetation such as grass and
foliage, fruit, bark, roots, fungi, seeds and nuts. He is active
all year but seldom accumulates much of a store of winter food.</p>
<p>Mainly nocturnal in habit, they are, however, occasionally
seen in the daytime. Their principal enemies here are hawks,
owls, weasels, coyotes and martens.</p>
<p>The young, from three to six in a litter, are born in June or
July and are duller in color than the parents.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: Large in size, mouse-like in appearance.
The fur is fairly long, soft and grayish buff in color, darker in
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the Colorado form, on the upperparts, white underparts and feet,
and a large, bushy, flattened almost squirrel-like tail. Total
length 15 to 16 inches. Sexes equal in size.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">

<p class="pcap">Wood Rat or Rock Rat</p>
</div>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Throughout the park. The gray wood rat mainly
in the transition zone in open country along the Yellowstone,
Lamar and Gardner Rivers and around Mammoth. Colorado
wood rat in higher portions of the park.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c34">ROCKY MOUNTAIN MUSKRAT
<br />Ondatra zibethica osoyoosensis</h3>
<p>Quiet streams or the shallow grassy margins of ponds and
lakes are the home of this valuable little fur-bearing animal.
More valuable than many people realize since few know that he
is the Hudson Seal and other trade names of our popular fur
coats. Ironically, muskrat fur is used as an excellent imitation
of his greatest enemy, the mink, in the mink-dyed muskrat coats.</p>
<p>A hardy little animal that lives much like the beaver, in bank
dens with underwater entrances or in dome-shaped houses made
of rushes, grass, turf and mud instead of the coarser sticks and
branches used by the beaver. In these houses or bank dens they
spend the winter in comfort. Remaining active all of the year
and seldom storing any food, muskrats are out in the coldest
weather.</p>
<p>Their food consists of bulbs and tubers, roots, tender portions
of numerous marsh and water plants, sedges, grass and clover,
and possibly some small aquatic animal life, salamanders, etc.
In the winter it is sometimes necessary to make extensive excursions
under the ice in search of food.</p>

<p>The young are born in the house or bank nests in May or
June, usually six or eight in a litter. In lower, milder sections
more than one litter is raised during the year. Fortunately
muskrats are prolific breeders.</p>
<p>The name muskrat originated from the fact that there are
two glands near the base of the tail that contain the strong though
not unpleasant musk, which may be left at intervals about his
haunts possibly as signs or marks of possession. While several
may use the winter house the muskrat is ordinarily rather fussy
and gets into frequent fights over territorial rights.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A rather large, robust, somewhat rat-like
appearing animal, with short legs and broad feet, the hind ones
partially webbed; tail long, scaly and sparsely haired, flattened
laterally. Ears scarcely showing above fur which is dense with
longer guard hairs. Upperparts are dark brown, underparts
lighter in appearance. Total length 23&frac12; inches, tail 10 inches;
weight about two pounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Throughout the park along moving streams, like
the Yellowstone River between Lake and Canyon, and most of
the ponds and lakes. Frequently working in the morning and
latter part of the afternoon as well as at night.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c35">PIKA
<br />Ochotona princeps ventorum</h3>
<p>This little Pika, Cony or Rock Rabbit of Yellowstone is in
reality a diminutive, tailless rabbit. Common in the higher elevations
wherever loose rock piles and slides offer suitable locations
for his home.</p>
<p>Timid and secretive in nature and possessing a protective
coloration that makes them hard to locate in their rocky homes,
the pikas are not often noticed by the majority of park visitors.
The call of a pika, a squeaky bleat, has an elusive quality that
confuses the hearer as to the direction in which it originated.</p>
<p>The best indications of the habitation of the pika are the small
stacks of hay among the rocks. He is an industrious little farmer
and is usually busy during the summer cutting and curing grass
and plant foliage for winter use. This material is first put in
the sun to cure, then piled in sheltered places among the rocks
where it will be accessible during the winter when the snow has
made a protective blanket over the landscape. In protected cavities
and runways beneath the rocks, with an ample supply of
hay, the pika has nothing to worry about during the winter months
and find no need to hibernate. Just what family activities they
have during this period is not known.</p>
<p>If an observer remains quiet near their rocky homes he may
soon be rewarded by a sight of them running silently about over
the rocks, and it may occasionally be possible to approach close
enough for a picture.</p>
<p>The young, from three to five in number, are born from late
May or early June to early September. Due to their secretive
nature and the location of their homes not a great deal is known
yet about the home life of the pika.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A short, chunky, apparently tailless rabbit-like
animal, ears rounded and of good size; legs short and hind
legs very little longer than forelegs. Color of upperparts grayish
to buffy, underparts whitish varying to cinnamon-buff. Sexes
alike in color and size; about 7&frac12; inches long, height to shoulder
3&frac12; inches and weight 4 to 7 ounces.</p>

<img src="images/p32.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="671" />
<p class="pcap">Cony or Pika</p>
</div>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Distributed throughout much of the park at elevations
above 7,000 feet wherever rock slides and talus slopes are
available. Most likely seen around the Golden Gate, Sheepeater
Cliffs, cliffs south and west of the Upper Geyser Basin, rockslides
along the Dunraven Pass road and other such places.
Look for the hay piles as indications. Active during the daytime.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c36">BLACK HILLS COTTONTAIL
<br />Sylvilagus nuttalli grangeri</h3>
<p>This shy and timid little rabbit leads a precarious existence
in the sagebrush-covered valleys of the lower portions of the
park. Its numerous enemies, especially the coyotes, foxes,
bobcats, hawks and owls keep the cottontail constantly on the
alert and seldom far from dense thickets or sheltering rocks.
Its short legs are not a match for the speedy coyote and so artful
dodging and hiding tactics must be resorted to.</p>
<p>The mother cottontail makes a nest, lined with her own fur,
in a sheltered place where the young, born blind, naked and helpless,
are placed. They grow rapidly and are soon able to run
about and play, then it isn&rsquo;t long until they are out on their own.
There are usually several litters born each year; this helps
keep up their numbers in spite of the inroads made by the various
enemies.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A small rabbit with short ears and legs.
Upperparts of creamy-buff color lightly grizzled with gray.
Tail short and fluffy, gray on top and white on underside. Total
length 15 to 16 inches.</p>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Most likely to be seen near Mammoth and in sagebrush
flats along the Gardner River. Mainly found in the transition
zone and lower. Most frequently out in the early morning,
evening or during the night.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c37">ROCKY MOUNTAIN SNOWSHOE RABBIT
<br />Lepus americanus bairdi</h3>
<p>The Varying Hare or Snowshoe Rabbit is found throughout
the higher parts of the mountains, fairly common but not abundant
in numbers. Provided by nature with special adaptations,
this rabbit is not bothered greatly by the winter storms and
snow. Very large furry hind feet act as snowshoes enabling
these rabbits to scamper readily over the snow without sinking
in and thus are the basis for its common name.</p>
<p>Nature also provides these hares with a camouflage to help
protect them from their enemies. Their summer coat of fur is
dull brown in color which blends well with the forest floor, while
in the winter they get a new coat of pure white, except for black
ear tips, making them hardly distinguishable from the snow
drifts over which they run. This varying color with the seasons
is the source for the other name by which it is known.</p>
<p>These rabbits, like other members of the family, depend upon
the foliage of plants and shrubbery as their principal food; however,
when this is buried beneath the winter&rsquo;s snow their diet is
frequently mainly composed of the bark of bushes and small
trees.</p>
<p>The snowshoe rabbit makes a nest in a sheltered place, where
the young, usually three or four in number, are born. These
young, unlike the cottontail, have their eyes open and are covered
with a coat of very fine close hair. They leave the nest in about
ten days. In some places there may be more than one litter in
a year.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: Larger than a cottontail with long ears and
hind legs. Color of upperparts (summer) buffy grayish brown
to rusty brown, underparts and bottoms of feet white; (winter)
white, with black-bordered tips of the ears and underparts pale
salmon. Total length about 18&frac12; inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p34.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="485" />
<p class="pcap">Varying Hare (Snowshoe Rabbit)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Likely to be seen almost anywhere in the wooded
sections of the park and near the camp and cabin areas. Especially
during the early morning and evening. They are generally
rather tame.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c38">WHITETAIL JACKRABBIT
<br />Lepus townsendi campanius</h3>
<p>This big Prairie Hare is readily distinguishable from the
other jackrabbits by its all white tail. It may also be found at
higher elevations than the other species of jacks. Normally
frequenting the open country it has been seen in alpine meadows
above timberline at 10,000 feet elevations. This species is the
largest of the jackrabbits.</p>
<p>All of the jackrabbits are known for their speed as they go
bounding over the prairie, covering twelve to fifteen feet at a
jump. The whitetail is the fastest and best jumper of the lot.
When in high-gear speed he is a match for all but the fleetest of
greyhounds.</p>
<p>The whitetail jackrabbit makes little if any nest for the
young, but like other rabbits, does have several forms scattered
about his home range. The form is simply a place just large
enough to accommodate his body, padded down and hollowed in a
clump of grass, weeds or bushes. Each individual has several
of these forms and when not out feeding or playing may usually
be found crouched down in one or the other of them. The young
are fully furred and have their eyes open when born. They are
active but stay hidden close by one spot for the first two or three
weeks. There are usually about four to the litter and there probably
is more than one litter each year, at least in the warmer
sections of their range.</p>
<p>The representatives of this species that live in the northern,
colder parts of the country change into a winter coat of white
fur each fall and like the snowshoe rabbit are protectively colored
when out in the snow. Their large feet also aid them in traveling
over the snowdrifts.</p>
<p><span class="u">General description</span>: A large, heavy bodied rabbit with large
ears, long legs, and a good sized fluffy tail that is all white
throughout the year. The color above is fairly uniform buffy
gray, underparts white. Its winter coat is much the same as the
summer, though paler in tone, except in the northern parts of
the range, which includes Yellowstone, where it becomes pure
white with black tipped ears and irregular buffy patches about
the face. Total length 24 inches.</p>

<p class="pcap">White-tailed Jack Rabbit</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p><span class="u">Where found</span>: Open sections in the northern parts of the park.
Has been seen on the highest slopes of Mount Washburn. Most
frequently seen in the early morning and evening. Not numerous.</p>
<h2 id="c39"><span class="small">ADDITIONAL ANIMALS</span></h2>
<p>The following animals are also found in the park area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint" id="c40"><span class="u">Bangs Flying Squirrel</span>: Glaucomys sabrinus bangsi. A medium-sized
squirrel, total length about 12.5 inches. Upperparts
dark grayish cinnamon; underparts pinkish
cinnamon.</p>
<p class="revintc">These squirrels are strictly nocturnal and for this
reason it is difficult to tell how common they really are.
Found only in the forested areas they nest in woodpecker
holes or in hollows in the trees or possibly build a nest
among branches or utilize old pine squirrel nests when
hollows are not available.</p>
<p class="revintc">Probably common throughout most of the forests of the
park.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c41"><span class="u">Mountain Weasel</span>: Mustela frenata arizonensis. A medium-sized
weasel about 14 to 15.4 inches long. Upperparts raw
umber-brown, darker on the head; underparts yellow to
orange with a white chin. In winter the animal is all white
with a black tip on the tail.</p>
<p class="revintc">Frequenting the more open ground in the park they live
primarily on rodents. In the winter they hunt beneath the
snow. I have seen them stick their heads up through the
snow, look around and quickly dive beneath again.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="u">Dwarf Weasel</span>: Mustela streatori leptus. A very small weasel
with a total length of not over 9.8 inches. Upperparts
dark brown; underparts white. In winter it is white with
black tip on the tail.</p>
<p class="revintc">Seldom seen but is probably found in most of the open
sections of the park as it is common on all sides.</p>
<p class="revintc">Weasels are strictly terrestrial and are very highly
carnivorous and blood thirsty. Very active and courageous
attacking without hesitation animals considerably larger
than themselves. They have very slender, long bodies and
short legs.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c42"><span class="u">Northern Plains Skunk</span>: Mephitis mephitis hudsonica. A large
skunk with a large bushy tail. Black in color with a broad
white stripe along each side of the back extending from
nape of neck to base of tail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p class="revintc">Reported as common in the lower northern valleys
along the Gardner, Yellowstone and Lamar Rivers and
occasional in other inland valleys by Bailey in 1923.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c43"><span class="u">Longtail Red Fox</span>: Vulpes fulva macrourus. This species has
a longer tail than the average red fox. In color it is a
reddish yellow to golden yellow with grizzled whitish;
underparts white; feet and lower part of legs black.</p>
<p class="revintc">The red fox although not common is occasionally seen
in the north and northeastern sections of the park. It was
at first regarded as rare but seems to be increasing somewhat
in recent years.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c44"><span class="u">Mountain Bobcat</span>: Lynx rufus uinta.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c45"><span class="u">Canada Lynx</span>: Lynx canadensis. These two animals are very
similar in habits though the lynx is more a dweller in the
colder forest regions while the bobcat may be found in
more open areas closer to habitation. Both have tufted
ears and a short tail and neither of the above species
has the distinct spots that are characteristic of some of
the species of bobcats. The lynx is the largest of the bobcats
and is slightly larger than the mountain bobcat. The
bobcat has a tail seven or eight inches long with two black
bands on the upper surface in front of a black tip while
the lynx has a tail only about four inches long and with
black only on the tip.</p>
<p class="revintc">These animals are rare in the park area and have only
been recorded in the northern section. My only observation
of one was about eight miles north of the park along
the Yellowstone River.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c46"><span class="u">Wolverine</span>: Gulo luscus. Heavily built animals with short
legs, short ears, a short bushy tail, and long coarse hair.
Appearing much like a small, short-legged bear. Total
length is from 37 to 41 inches and weight from 22 to 35
pounds. It is dark brown or blackish in color with two
broad, pale, lateral bands of brownish white to yellowish
white from shoulder to rump.</p>
<p class="revintc">The wolverine is a powerful and savage fighter, strictly
carnivorous and well earns its name of &ldquo;glutton.&rdquo; It had
a bad reputation among trappers for it followed their trap
lines, robbed and even broke up their traps and dug up
their food caches. Wolverines are no longer common in
this part of the country and while there may have been a
number of them in the park area some years ago they are
probably only very rare visitors now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p class="revint" id="c47"><span class="u">Brown Pocket Gopher</span>: Thomomys talpoides fuscus. The piles
of dirt which suddenly appear in the grass of lawns or
meadows are made by the pocket gopher. He excavates a
network of tunnels below the sod line, pushing the dirt
through an opening on to the surface, then filling the opening
up again. Their food consists of vegetable matter such
as roots, bulbs, tubers and surface foliage and green vegetation.</p>
<p class="revintc">The pocket gopher is rather small in size, about eight
inches long, including a tail of a little over two inches,
and is light brown in color. The tail is only sparsely
haired and the front feet are large and built for digging.
The Uinta ground squirrel or picket-pin is frequently referred
to by some people as a gopher, but it should not be
confused with the true gopher and is seldom seen above
the ground.</p>
<p class="revintc">Found in meadows and open areas throughout the park.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c48"><span class="u">Rocky Mountain Jumping Mouse</span>: Zapus princeps. Sometimes
called Kangaroo Mouse this little animal is a medium-sized
mouse with greatly elongated hind legs and a slender
tail nearly six inches long. Its upperparts are yellowish
brown lightly sprinkled with blackish, the underparts
white.</p>
<p class="revintc">This mouse lives on vegetation and seeds. It is found
throughout the park in meadows and open country but nowhere
abundantly. It hibernates during the winter.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c49"><span class="u">Gale Redback Mouse</span>: Clethrionomys gapperi galei. These
mice live on green vegetation, seeds, roots and stems and
probably occupy most of the forested sections of the park.
They live in burrows and are not very often seen. Several
have been trapped in residences in Mammoth. They are
active all winter under the snow.</p>
<p class="revintc">They are small to medium sized mice with the upperparts
reddish chestnut distinctly differing from the buffy
gray sides; underparts whitish to yellowish gray.</p>
<p class="revint" id="c50"><span class="u">Dusky Shrew</span>: Sorex obscurus.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="u">Mountain Water Shrew</span>: Sorex palustris navigator. Most
species of shrews are smaller than any mice, with pointed
noses, minute eyes, and small ears which are hidden in
the fur. They are insect eaters and like any kind of fresh
meat. They are active all winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p class="revintc">The dusky shrew is a sepia brown in color and is found
throughout most of the park area. Mountain water shrews
make their homes in banks of icy streams and are mouse-size
with upper parts slaty mixed with hoary. They have
larger feet than the dusky shrew and have bristly fringes
along the toes with partial webs which equip them for swimming
readily.</p>
<p class="revintc">The <span class="u">Rocky Mountain Shrew</span> (Sorex vagrans monticola)
has been collected once in the park and it is also probable
that the <span class="u">Masked Shrew</span> (Sorex cinereus) is also here as it
has been found in the surrounding area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="c51">According to Bailey, Yeager and others the following bats
have been found in the park during the summer, all migrating
south for the winter:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="u">Big Brown Bat</span>: Eptesicus fuscus</p>
<p class="t">Numerous over the central plateau section.</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="u">Hoary Bat</span>: Lasiurus cinereus</p>
<p class="t">A few range over most of the park.</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="u">Long-eared Bat</span>: Myotis evotis</p>
<p class="t">Numerous in the lower portions of the park.</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="u">Silver-haired Bat</span>: Lasionycteris noctivagans</p>
<p class="t">Fairly numerous in timbered areas.</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="u">Yellowstone Bat</span>: Myotis lucifugus carissima</p>
<p class="t">Numerous over most of the park and especially at Lake and around the Devils Kitchen at Mammoth.</p>
